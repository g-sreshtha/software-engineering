# Microservices - What are they?

Microservices are an organisational approach to software development that splits an application into smaller, independent services 
- split based on specific business functionalities
- must be self contained and independent of eachother, loosecoupling.
- services can be build and deployed separately for example for an ecommerce website, if a customer wants to pay, then the API only needs to build and deploy the payment service and nothing else is affected given that it is split up into correct services.
- 

## the downsides of microservices:
- new challenges are introduced
- configuring the communication between services adds complexity just by the fact that it is a distributed system.

-> however there are tools being developed to combat this i.e kubernetes
